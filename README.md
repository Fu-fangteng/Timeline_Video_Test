# Timeline-Video

## Project Overview
The Timeline-Video project aims to create videos from a timeline perspective. This project utilizes several time-lapse videos as source material and generates final images by calculating the average color of pixels in each frame.

## How to Use
You cna use the code in your own IDE, it is very short. Remember to change the name in the code into your own video's name. Ensure the address is correct and it is in the mp4 format. You can change the variablel called "gridSize" to see the images generated at different levels of clarity. This project includes two methods for generating images: row by row and column by column.
